### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

        Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I thought it was so interesting that it took what would be such a difficult task for a human to do, compiling all of these counties and populations, and made it so simple and easy to complete. Working with a large amount of numbers has always been intriguing for me.

* Lab 6

        Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because it was about sandwiches. I love food and anything that has to do with food will make me more intrigued and invested into the project. It is also cool how we used computer science for a more practical real life purpose.
        
* Lab 9

        Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because it was about math. I feel like anything that has to do with math I really enjoy because it is something that is real, not made up or imaginary. Working with math is something I really enjoy. That is also why I like my Calculus class.
